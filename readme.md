# Canadian University AI Guidelines Directory

A simple, open directory of Canadian university guidance on generative AI in teaching, learning, and research.

This site is designed primarily for:
- **Canadian university teaching and learning units** (e.g., Centres for Teaching & Learning, Teaching Commons, Educational Development units)
- **Canadian instructors** looking to understand how their own institution — or others — are approaching generative AI

The goal is not to rank or judge policies, but to make them **easy to find, compare, and discuss**.

## Why this project exists

Across Canada, universities are responding to generative AI in very different ways. Some institutions have detailed, instructor-focused guidance. Others rely on student integrity pages, research library guides, or high-level policy statements.

As someone who works at the intersection of **higher education, AI literacy, and educational technology**, I’ve seen how difficult it can be for instructors and teaching centres to:
- quickly find relevant guidance
- understand how different institutions are framing AI use
- avoid reinventing work that already exists elsewhere

This project grew out of a desire to reduce that friction and support **thoughtful, transparent, and pedagogically grounded** uses of AI in higher education.

## How to use the directory

Each university card includes:
- A direct link to its AI-related guidance (when available)
- Simple tags indicating the *primary audience* of the resource:
  - **Instructor ✅**
  - **Student 👨‍🎓**
  - **Research 🔬**
  - **Generic 🌐**
- A **PDF badge** where applicable

You can filter resources using **AND logic**, making it easy to find, for example:
> Instructor + Research guidance  
or  
> Generic, institution-wide principles

## What this project is *not*

- It is **not** an endorsement or evaluation of any policy
- It does **not** assess quality, effectiveness, or “best practice”
- It does **not** attempt to resolve institutional differences around AI

The directory exists to support **informed conversations**, not prescribe answers.

## About the creator

This project was created by **Charlie Gedeon**.

My work focuses on helping educators and institutions develop **AI literacy**, make sense of emerging technologies, and navigate change in higher education with care rather than panic. I’ve spoken publicly — including in a TEDx talk — about the importance of empowering educators to understand AI systems, rather than treating them as opaque threats or magic tools.

This directory reflects that philosophy:  
> clarity over confusion, comparison over isolation, and learning over fear.
